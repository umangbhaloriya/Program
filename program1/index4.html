                <h1>Camping essentials</h1>
                <p>Packing the right gear is crucial for having a good time on your next camping trip. Make sure you bring the right stuff using the checklist below.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Tent:</strong> Don't get stuck sleeping outside. Check out some great <a href="#">tents.</a></li>
                    <li><strong>Sleeping bag:</strong> A warm sleeping bag can be the difference between a cozy, restful night, and a miserable one.</li>
                    <li><strong>Headlamp:</strong> Being able to see in the dark is important for safety.</li>
                    <li><strong>Small stove:</strong> Sleeping outside doesn't mean eating only granola bars! Cook yourself a warm meal with a small, portable gas stove.</li>
                    <li><strong>Gas bottle:</strong> Your stove needs fuel. Gas bottles can be purchased at any <a href="#">camping store.</a></li>
                    <li><strong>Dehydrated meals:</strong> Fill a dehydrated meal bag with boiling water, wait several minutes, et voil√†; dinner is served.</li>
                    <li><strong>Rain gear:</strong> Hiking while drenched is never fun, but sometimes it's unavoidable. Packing the right kind of rain gear will help you stay as comfortable and warm as possible.</li>
                    <li><strong>Water pack:</strong> If your hike is longer, you may prefer a camping-specific water container instead of a traditional bottle. We put together some <a href="#">suggestions.</a></li>
                    <li><strong>Hiking shoes</strong> It can be hard to pick a hiking shoe, but your most versatile shoe often will come up to your ankle (or slightly hire) and is comfortable to walk in, even at the end of the day. Tip: make sure to really break in your hiking shoes before wearing them on a trek for the first time!</li>
